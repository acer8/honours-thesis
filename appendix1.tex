\section{Error analysis on Chorin's original projection method}

\subsection{Notation and Preliminaries}
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional spaces
\end{itemize}
1. $\textit{L}^p$ space\\
A space of $p$th power integrable functions. (space for which the p-th power of the absolute value is Lebesgue integrable). $\textbf{should I give a very precise and formal definition?}$\\

2. Sobolev space\\
A subspace of $\textit{L}^p$ in which the functions contained has the property that its weak derivatives up to kth order has finite $\textit{L}^p$ norm.
\begin{equation}
||f||_{k,p} = (\sum^k_{i=0} \int_{\Omega} |f^{(i)} (x)|^p dx)^{\dfrac{1}{p}} 
\end{equation}

In this case we are concerned with the $\textit{L}^2 (\Omega) $ space (space of square integrable functions on bounded regular domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ where $d=1,2,3$) and Sobolev space up to derivative one ($\textit{H}^1 (\Omega)$).\\
Hence we have the following norms:
